There was once a cactus called Sari, a mushroom called Elisa, a conifer called Jesper,
a deciduous called Martyna, and a succulent called Dima.
"Your flower is so short-lived, Sari" the deciduous said, "as a Cactus it only blooms once
and then wilts off."

At the beach everyone was extremely happy. Elisa jumped over the waves. Jesper was diving. 
Martyna was fishing. Dima and Sari were making sandcastles. The sunset was approaching and
the sunlight reflected in the water.

sari_paragraph3 = '''
The sunset turned sinister as Jesper's shocking confession about secretly dating Elisa's sister tore their friendship apart.
Elisa's heartache was palpable, while nearby, Martyna and Dima's feud boiled over
when Martyna defiantly unfolded her carefully drawn map, leading to a fIrEy confrontation.
Sari, caught in the crossfire, felttttttttttt their cherished tradition disintegrate,
a bittersweet memory of happier days as the sun dipped below the horizon.
