martyna_paragraph1 = f'''
As the seasons changed, {cactus}, Martyna, {mushroom}, {conifer}, and {succulent} continued to embrace their unique roles in the forest.
To celebrate their differences they decided to go to the beach and have fun.

martyna_paragraph2 = f'''
The friends' tradition of watching sunsets together grew into something truly special.
However, one evening the once serene sunset turned into a dramatic spectacle. 
{mushroom} and {conifer}'s friendship unraveled, bitterness poisoning their interactions. 
Martyna and {succulent}'s clashes over sunset locations escalated into shouting matches, 
and {cactus}, torn between loyalties, found herself in the crossfire of their animosity. 
As the last rays of sunlight were disappearing, the tensions were rising.

martyna_paragraph3 = f'''
Unfortunately, {mushroom} and {conifer} never reconciled even though {cactus} tried her best to bring their friendship back. 
The withdrawal of {succulent} led to him finally leaving the country and Martyna decided to disappear as well, she sailed out into the darkness.

By the way, they were still all plants (except for that one mushroom). That just got lost along the way. What with the beach stuff happening.
But they were definitely plants. With the chloroplast and everything. Did you know that half of cacti are pollinated
by bats at night? There is only one species of cactus native to Africa, all the others are 
native to the Americas. They are easy to care for, have their own unique beauty and bloom beautifully. 
Cacti are really cool.
