dima_paragraph1 = f'''
{cactus}, {mushroom}, {conifer}, Dima and {decidious} knew they were unique in their own way and had a purpose. 
They stood together in the fading light, feeling content with their differences and the beauty of their unity.
'''

dima_paragraph2 = f'''
They decided to start a tradition of watching sunsets together whenever they could, 
a bond forged by nature's breathtaking display. Each subsequent sunset became a cherished moment in {cactus}'s, {mushroom}'s, {conifer}'s, Dima's and {decidious}'s friendship.
'''

dima_paragraph3 = f'''
Weeks had passed since that fateful night on the beach, and the once tight-knit group of friends had drifted even further apart. 
{mushroom} had tried to reach out to {conifer}, hoping for some sort of reconciliation, but her attempts were met with cold indifference.
{decidious} and Dima, on the other hand, had withdrawn from the group entirely.
{cactus}, the one who had once held them all together, felt a heavy burden of guilt and sadness.
